31 ContributorsStole My Heart Lyrics
Waiting for a girl like you


The light shines, it's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends, they look good and you look better


Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come around, 'round, 'round


Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you


I'm weaker, my worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh, life, come on 'head, don't you fail me now
I start to say, "I think I love you," but I make no sound
You might also like
And, oh, 'cause all my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come around


Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you


There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground, I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
'Cause there's so much that I wanna say
I wanna say


Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart
Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

Been waiting for a girl like you
