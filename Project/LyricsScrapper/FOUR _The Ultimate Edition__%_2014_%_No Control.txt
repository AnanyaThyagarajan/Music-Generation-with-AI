64 ContributorsNo Control Lyrics
Oh
(Oh, oh)


Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case


Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control


(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)


Taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day
You might also like
Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control


Lost my senses, I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours


Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control


Oh
No control
Oh
No control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
