Lights go down, and
The night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices
Singing songs in the street, and I know


That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
That I won't be on my own
Yeah, I love this feeling and


Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)
'Cause right now, everything is new to me (Ooh)
You know, I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)


Late-night spaces
With all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces
Just like how it used to be


And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
I won't be on my own
On my own, I'm feeling like
You might also like
Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)
'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)
You know, I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)


And I could do this forever (Woah, woah-oh)
And let's go crazy together (Woah, woah-oh)


Lights go down, and
I hear you calling to me, yeah


Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)
'Cause right now everything is new to me (Ooh)
You know, I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)
