28 ContributorsLoved You First Lyrics
Girl, it should be me driving to your house
Knockin' on your door and kissing you on the mouth
Holdin' on your hand, dancin' in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start


But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart because


I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first


Girl, it should be me callin' on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time lookin' in your eyes


But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart because
You might also like
I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first


First touch, the first kiss
First girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak, it's killing me
I loved you first, why can't you see?


I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first


Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin' (Coulda been where he is)
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first


Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah
Baby I loved you first
