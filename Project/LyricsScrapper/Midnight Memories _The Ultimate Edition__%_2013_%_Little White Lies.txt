If this room was burnin'
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies


You say it's gettin' late, it's gettin' late
And you don't know if you can stay, if you can stay
But you, you don't tell the truth, no, you, you like playing games
Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're sayin' what we do when it's only me and you
I can't concentrate


That's all I'm thinkin' about, all I keep thinkin' about
Everythin' else just fades away


If this room was burnin'
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
You might also like
Back seat of the cab, we're in the cab
My lips getting so attached, they're so attached
Now, you wanna make some rules
Now, cool, then we'll watch them break tonight


I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long


If this room was burnin'
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies


I know you want it
I know you feel it, too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do



If this room was burnin' (Burnin', burnin')
I wouldn't even notice (Yeah)
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind (Taking up my mind; With your)
With your little white lies, little white lies (Little white lies)
You say you're a good girl (A good girl; Good girl)
But I know you would, girl (Know you would, girl)
'Cause you've been telling me all night (All night; With your)
With your little white lies, little white lies (Little white lies, with your)
With your little white lies, little white lies
