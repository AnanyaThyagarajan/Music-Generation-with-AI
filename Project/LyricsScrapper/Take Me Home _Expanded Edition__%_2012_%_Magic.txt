B-B-B-Baby, c'mon over
I don't care if people find out
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)
They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)


But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
(Da-da, da-da-da) I can't hold back


'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic


So le-le-let them take the pictures
Spread it all around the world now
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)
You might also like
But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
(Da-da, da-da-da) I can't hold back


'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic


Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
Everything you do is magic


They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now


Everything you do is magic (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Everything you do is magic (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Everything you do is magic (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Everything you do is ma-a-agic

'Cause you, you've got this spell on me (Yeah, spell on me)
I don't know what to believe (Believe)
Kiss you once, now I can't leave (I can't leave, yeah)
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic (Magic)


Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (C'mon)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Kiss you once now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic
(Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da, da)
