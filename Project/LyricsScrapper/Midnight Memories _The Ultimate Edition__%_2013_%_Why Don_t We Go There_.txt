I know you want, know you wanna take it slow
Think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight, just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key


'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride out in the cold air
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh


Say the word, say the word, but don't say no
Skydive, you and I with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me, there's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see we'd do it anyway


'Cause we got all night, we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride out in the cold air
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh


Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say no, just let go


'Cause we got all night and we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride (Let's take a ride) out in the cold air
I know the way (I know the way), why don't you go there with me?


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
With me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
With me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you go there with me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
