He knows about you in every way
He's memorised every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know


Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favourite band, the way that you dance
But baby, baby


Does he know you can move it like that? Woah
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
Does he know?


I catch your eye, then you turn away
But there's no hidin' the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around and girl, you let me know


Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
He knows how you dance in front of your friends
But baby, baby
You might also like
Does he know you can move it like that? Woah
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
Does he know?


He'll never know
The way you lie when you look at me
So keep tryin', but you know I see
All the little things that make you who you are
So tell me, girl


Does he know you can move it like that?
And does he know that you'll never go back?
Woah


Does he know you can move it like that? Woah
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad? Oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back? Oh
Does he know?
