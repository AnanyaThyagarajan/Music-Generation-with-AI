28 ContributorsSave You Tonight Lyrics
I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh


It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it


All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes, but they stay closed, closed


I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight


Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
'Cause he don't adore ya
To him, you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya
You might also like
What you want, what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears


I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight


Up, up and away
I'll take you with me
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me


I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman (Oh)
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
