36 ContributorsChange My Mind Lyrics
The end of the night, we should say goodbye
But we carry on while everyone's gone


Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure


But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind


Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs
There's no music on, but we dance along


Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure
You might also like
But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind


I'll change my mind


Baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind


But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind
