16 ContributorsAnother World Lyrics
It's not me, it's not you, there's a reason
I'm just tryna read the signals I'm receivin'
Just like a stone on fire, can you feel it?
I don't know about you, girl, but I believe it


Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life


I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Everyday, in every way, oh-oh-oh
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world


One for me, one for you, whatcha doin'?
Girl, the music sounds so good when you're movin'
Let me take you higher, let me prove it
'Cause, hey, hey, pretty girl, I believe it


Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life
You might also like
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Everyday, in every way (In every way, yeah, yeah), oh-oh-oh
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world


Take you to another world
You know I'll take you to another world


Baby, let me find out your secret
Just let me in and let me show you that I keep it
Close to my heart, jump in the deep end
Just let me in and let me show you what I'm meanin'


I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world


Everyday (Everyday), in every way (In every way, yeah, yeah), oh-oh-oh
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world (Take you to another world)

Take you to another world (Oh-oh, yeah)
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Yeah, yeah
Take you to another world (Woah, oh)
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
