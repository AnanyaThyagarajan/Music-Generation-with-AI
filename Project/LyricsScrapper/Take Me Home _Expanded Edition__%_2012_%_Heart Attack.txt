46 ContributorsHeart Attack Lyrics
Baby, you got me sick, I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
Got your voice in my head saying, "Let's just be friends"
Can't believe the words came outta your mouth, yeah


I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right


And I'm, like, (Ow!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And (Ow!)
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one
It's (Ow!) giving me a heart attack
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh


Yeah, baby, now that you're gone, I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinkin' about, yeah
Everyone's telling me, I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah


I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right
You might also like
And I'm, like, (Ow!)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And (Ow!)
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted (Yeah), thought you would be the one
It's (Ow!) giving me a heart attack (Huh)
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh


(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh (Ow!)
Yeah, every time you look like that (Ow!)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
*Oh-oh, oh* (Ow!)
You're giving me a heart attack


But seeing you with him just don't feel right


And I'm, like, (Ow!; Never thought it'd hurt so bad)
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And (Ow!; You're giving me a heart attack)
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted (Ever wanted),  thought you would be the one
It's (Ow!) giving me a heart attack (C'mon)
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You, you're all I ever wanted (Ow!)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, yeah, every time you look like that, c'mon (Ow!)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're all I ever wanted (Ow!)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're giving me a heart attack (Ow!)
