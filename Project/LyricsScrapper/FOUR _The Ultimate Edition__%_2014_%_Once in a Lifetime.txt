Once in a lifetime, it's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even a landslide or riptide
Could take it all away


Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you


When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side


Once in a lifetime, it's just right
And we are always safe
Not even the bad guys in the dark night
Could take it all away


(Ooh) Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
(Ooh) Out loud, someone's calling my name
And it sounds like you
You might also like
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side


You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side


Once in a lifetime, you were mine
