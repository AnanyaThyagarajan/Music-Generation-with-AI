31 ContributorsBack For You Lyrics
Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
I'm lookin' out at the crowd, you're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up, you're hearing me say goodbye


Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you


I've never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch, I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah
'Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say, goodbye


Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
You might also like
Right back for you, oh-woah
Right back for you, right back for you


Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back
Yeah, I am coming back for you


Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, for you (For you, woah)
Lately, I've been going crazy (Crazy, yeah)
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you (Yeah)


Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you (C'mon)
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
