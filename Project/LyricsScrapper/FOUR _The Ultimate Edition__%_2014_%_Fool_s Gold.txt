I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time


But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star


And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold


I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me


And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part
You might also like
And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold
Oh


Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel


And, yes, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold


Oh
Oh
Oh, hmm
